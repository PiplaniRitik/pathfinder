# Pathfinder Visualizer

The Pathfinder Visualizer is a web application that utilizes JavaScript to implement popular pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS). The project aims to provide a visual representation of how these algorithms work on a 2D grid.

## Features

- **Algorithm Selection:**
  - Choose from Dijkstra's, BFS, and DFS algorithms to visualize the pathfinding process.

- **Interactive Grid:**
  - Display a 2D grid on the screen where you can interactively select start and end points.

- **Algorithm Visualization:**
  - Watch the selected algorithm in action as it explores the grid and finds the shortest path from the start to the end.

- **User-Friendly Controls:**
  - Easily reset the grid, select new start and end points, and visualize different algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:**
  - The core logic of the pathfinding algorithms and grid manipulation.

- **HTML & CSS:**
  - Structuring the webpage and styling the user interface.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
